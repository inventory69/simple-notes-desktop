feat(delete): add server deletion tracking with Android sync awareness

- Add shared confirmDeletion() method in DialogService for consistent deletion warnings
- Implement single and batch delete confirmation dialogs
- Update delete flow to inform users about server-side deletion behavior
- Add Android-specific messaging about "Deleted on Server" status
- Improve error messaging for failed delete operations

This ensures users understand that deleted notes are immediately removed from the WebDAV server
and will appear as "Deleted on Server" on Android devices until manually removed there.

Files changed:
- src/services/DialogService.js: new confirmDeletion(count) method
- src/components/NoteEditor.js: updated handleDelete() to use new dialog
